# MAF_Bayesian
Bayesian parameter estimation and prediction in multidirectional composite laminates subjected to multiaxial loading

## Main file for Bayesian inference 
The main file to run the Bayesian inference is `MAF_gp_hv_ipynb` with some necessary functions defined in `maf_gp.py`. 

## Post-process
The post-process files are the `posterior_...` files for three different frameworks:
- no bias
- bias $E_1$
- bias $\alpha$
